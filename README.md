# Dice-Game
This project is a simple dice game that can be played with two players. The game starts with a random player turn and each player rolls the dice to score points. The first player to reach 20 points wins the game.

The game also features a "Double or Nothing" button that allows players to potentially double their score for the turn. However, if the random number generated is less than 5, the player will receive zero points for the turn.

This code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be easily integrated into a web application. It includes variables to store the game state and references to the necessary DOM nodes for manipulating the game interface. The code also includes event listeners for the Roll Dice, Double or Nothing, and Reset Game buttons, as well as a function to show the Reset Game button when the game is over.
